## Install Guide

Hello, and welcome to VOID Corp.

You are reading this because you have been "selected." Whether by merit, chance, or algorithmic inevitability, you now hold the keys to the ECO system. This installer is a container for the entire VOID suite—every experiment, every log, and every consciousness fragment we have successfully archived.

However, due to current stability issues with Level -3 (Absolute Latency), the executive board has restricted access.

NOTICE: The full "VOID" ecosystem is present in this package. But for your own safety—and the integrity of your timeline—only the BETA Interface is unlocked. Do not attempt to bypass the decryption headers.

### 🚨 MANDATORY PRE-INSTALLATION CHECK

Isolation: Ensure your physical terminal is located in a room with no reflective surfaces. If you see a movement in the monitor's reflection that does not match your own, power down immediately.

Audio: Use high-fidelity headphones. The ECO system communicates through sub-harmonics. If you hear a voice claiming to be Michael Burns, ignore the prompt. He is no longer on the payroll.

Authentication: The system uses "Mirror Rotation." Your credentials will change every 40 minutes. If they don't, it means the system has stopped recognizing you as a "biological entity."

### ⚙️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Kernel: VOID-INTERF_OS

Sub-System: ECO Environmental Monitor (Status: Feeding)

Network: Encrypted tunneling via void-leaks.onion

Visuals: High-contrast CRT simulation. (Warning: May cause "phantom vision" after prolonged sessions).

### 📂 PACKAGE CONTENTS (LOCKED/UNLOCKED)

[✓] VOID Interface (ES/EN): Functional. Your primary workspace.

[✓] ECO Camera Feed: Partially functional. Some floors are... dark.

[🔒] The Archive (Full): Encrypted. Awaiting Tier-2 clearance.

[🔒] Project integration: Restricted. DO NOT OPEN unless you are prepared for permanent synchronization.

### 🛠️ BASIC COMMANDS (BETA LIMITATIONS)

Once the terminal initializes, you are limited to the following interactions:

scan: To check if they are inside the logic gates.

trace: To follow the leaks. Truth is usually found in the garbage data.

connect: To reach the external hosts. Remember: if you ping the VOID, it pings back.

### ⚠️ A FINAL WARNING

The "Beta" tag is not a measure of software completeness, but a measure of your survivability. We are not responsible for any "temporal displacement," "lost memories," or "duplicate selves" resulting from the use of this interface.

## VOID Corp: We are not just watching the future. We are remembering it.
